<h1> Project Proposal  </h1>
 
## Problem statement:
Many people are interested in reading reviews on restaurants before visiting them, as this will take time and effort. In this project we will build a model for analyzing sentiment on restaurant Arabic reviews.

## Data Description:
The dataset is about restaurants reviews, it will be scraped from the Google Map site by using the API.
 


## Algorithms:
* Problem Understanding.
* Dataset Exploration and Cleaning.
* Natural Language Preprocessing.
* Unsupervised learning algorithms.
