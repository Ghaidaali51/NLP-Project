# Resturant Reviews By Using NLP & Topic Modeling


# Abstract

One of the three largest sectors affected (positively or negatively) by customer evaluation and comments is the restaurant sector, and the influence of Google Map - as an application or a browser - is increasing significantly on investors in restaurants or cafes day after day, as Google Map is one of the most important means on which it depends. The public can choose the places for their visits to the restaurant or cafe, and try the food and drinks it offers, as people are interested in what is mentioned in the comments in terms of the quality of the food, the place and the service provided. In this project, One of the three largest sectors affected (positively or negatively) by customer evaluation and comments is the restaurant sector, and the influence of Google Map - as an application or a browser - is increasing significantly on investors in restaurants or cafes day after day, as Google Map is one of the most important means on which it depends. The public can choose the places for their visits to the restaurant or cafe, and try the food and drinks it offers, as people are interested in what is mentioned in the comments in terms of the quality of the food, the place and the service provided. In this project, we will analyze the comments and determine whether the restaurant was good or not without having to read the comments as soon as possible.

# Algorithms
* Problem Understanding.
* Dataset Cleaning: unimportant columns - duplicated.
* NLP Preprocessing: Convert to lowercase - Remove punctuation - Remove Stopword - Lemmatizer - Remove Emoji - Construct document-term matrix.
* Unsupervised learning (clustering - topic modeling).
* EDA.

# Tools
* Technologies: Python program language - Jupiter Notebook.
* Libraries: Panda - statsmodels - matplotlib - NumPy - sklearn - WordCloud - NLTK.

# Models
* LSA
* NMF
* LDA
* KMeans

We choose Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
